            <p class="lead">How I made it, what I found, and issues.</p>
            <hr class="my-4">
            <p>I wanted to create a simple map with clickable icons on locations I've been that would bring up pictures and a description of the location.</p>
            <p>I found and based it on <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/solutions/store-locator/simple-store-locator">Google's Simple Store Locator</a>. I removed everything that didnt break what features I needed to remove extra code, and help me understand what was there.</p>
            <p>I was able to determine that the popup window is controlled by the following code:</p>
            <!-- embeds the image in a shadow box -->
            <div class="shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded"><img src="img/code.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"></div>
            <p>From there I edited the .JSON file to add the new data fields for each item, as well as adding all the locations. I chose 3 images from the 5 locations, and added them to my img folder. With that I was able to add <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/carousel/#with-captions">Bootstraps's image carousel with captions</a> to display the images as I desired. I had to be sure to enable Bootstrap's Javascript to enable the image scrolling.</p>
            <p>Then lastly I added a menu bar to allow the user to access all 4 pages as requred!</p>
